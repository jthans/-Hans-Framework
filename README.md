This repository is a collection my personal libraries I'm working on in C#/.NET.  This started out with a focus on gaming libraries, but as the code expanded, it became clear I could use these libraries for other reasons, especially quick PoCs to test logic or something similar.  So this library has transitioned into a collection of my "Core" code.  I will plan to migrate any game or program specific code to other repositories, for prime organization.
